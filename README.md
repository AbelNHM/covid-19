This is my final project of the Ironhack bootcamp. It is a full-stack web application developed in Javascript with Node.js and React.

Its objective is to present the data collected from the covid19.mathdro.id/api API using statistics, graphs and a heat map, as well as news about coronavirus from different media.

The application has a private part that allows registering and managing new cases of infected people, offering a real-time notification service to those users who are nearby.

In addition, admin users can manage the database, creating or removing users, as well as their health status.

The following technologies and frameworks have been used in the development of the application: React, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, AJAX, Passport, WebSocket and Material-UI.
